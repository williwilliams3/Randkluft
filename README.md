# Randkluft

**Randkluft** is an interactive Shiny application for automated, reproducible gating of marker expression in multiplexed tissue imaging data (CyCIF, CODEX, CosMX, and similar platforms).

> *Manuscript under review in **Bioinformatics**.*
> Live app: [https://irscope.shinyapps.io/Randkluft/](https://irscope.shinyapps.io/Randkluft/)

## Overview

In multiplexed imaging, true-positive cells (high marker intensity) are frequently obscured by a large background population of true-negative cells with low intensity. Defining a reliable, objective gating threshold is therefore non-trivial and highly operator-dependent.

Randkluft addresses this by analysing the **density profile of each marker distribution**. Using a stochastic search strategy inspired by the **Robbins–Monro algorithm**, it iteratively locates a discriminative threshold within the right-hand shoulder of the distribution — the region where rare positive cells reside — without requiring manual initialisation or distributional assumptions.

The algorithm converges when the sub-distribution below the candidate threshold reaches a skewness of zero, meaning the background population is approximately symmetric and the positive tail has been isolated.

## Input format

Randkluft expects a **cell-by-marker CSV table** with the following columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `imageid` | string | Sample / image identifier (one per row) |
| `X_centroid` | numeric | X spatial coordinate of the cell |
| `Y_centroid` | numeric | Y spatial coordinate of the cell |
| `<MarkerName>` | numeric | One column per marker (raw or log-transformed intensity) |

- DNA / Hoechst / DAPI channels are **automatically detected and excluded** from gating.
- If values are raw (max > 20), they are **log-transformed automatically**.
- An example file (`exemplar-001--unmicst_cell.csv`) is provided and can also be downloaded from within the app.
